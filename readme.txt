Re-Center Admin is a plugin designed to do exactly what it says - re-center the WordPress 2.5 Admin interface.

== Description ==

2.5 brought many great UI changes, but a few seem unfounded and, in my opinion, were steps backward. I've never been a fan of left-aligned interfaces. This plugin resets the interface to the center of the window.  All proper credit to "Remove Max Width" by Dion Hulse - http://dd32.id.au - all I really did was regress and modify some CSS...

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `re-center-admin` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
